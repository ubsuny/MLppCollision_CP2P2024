### TensorFlow Integration Explanation

In the C++ code provided, TensorFlow is utilized to perform a specific mathematical computation, specifically the calculation of the square root of a variable (`H1_PX`).

#### 1. Session Initialization:
   - A TensorFlow session is initialized at the beginning of the `plotBpmassCP()` function. This session is created using `tensorflow::NewSession()`, which generates a new TensorFlow session object. This session will be responsible for executing the TensorFlow operations.

#### 2. TensorFlow Calculation of Square Root (as a demonstration):
   - Inside the loop over the events, TensorFlow is used to calculate the square root of the `H1_PX` variable.
   - A TensorFlow tensor (`x_tensor`) of type `tensorflow::Tensor` is created to hold the value of `H1_PX`.
   - The value of `H1_PX` is assigned to the `x_tensor` using scalar assignment.
   - The TensorFlow session is executed using `session->Run()`, with the input tensor `x_tensor` provided as input to the computation.
   - The result of the square root calculation is obtained from the output tensor of the TensorFlow session.
   - Finally, the computed square root result is printed to the console for analysis and verification.
