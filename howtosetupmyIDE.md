# Adding PyTorch Feature to GitHub Codespace

This guide outlines the steps to customize a GitHub Codespace by adding the "PyTorch" feature:

## Step 1: Create Devcontainer Folder and JSON File

- Create a folder named `.devcontainer` in your GitHub repository.
- Inside the `.devcontainer` folder, create a `devcontainer.json` file (This will help launch codespace).

## Step 2: Launch GitHub Codespace

- Launch a new GitHub Codespace from your repository.
- Select the option to create a new Codespace with your custom configuration.

## Step 3: Add PyTorch Feature

- Add the "PyTorch" feature to the configuration.
- "Pytorch" is a Machine Learning (ML) framework

## Step 4: Commit the Change

- After adding the PyTorch feature, commit the modifications to your local repository.

## Step 5: Push Changes to Main Repository

- Push the committed changes to the main branch of your GitHub repository.
- This ensures that the updated `devcontainer.json` file is available for future Codespace launches.

Following these steps will enable you to incorporate the PyTorch feature into your GitHub Codespace, providing a tailored environment for your development needs.
